# password_generator

This project is a pure C language prorgram capable of generating a unique password everytime it is executed.
This is my first project in C 

#Function

Currently the program can

 1.Generate a random passowrd and save it in a 'password.txt' file.
 
 
 2.View the generated passwords
 
 
 you can generate any number of passwords and the program will keep adding it in the list

To delete a password you'll have to manually open the passwords file and remove the unwanted password.
Also make sure to not delete the 'password.txt' file 

I'm still new to programming so feel free to correct me if i did something wrong or if something could be done in a better way.
